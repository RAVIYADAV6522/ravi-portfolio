          I love using technology to build things that make a real impact on
          people&apos;s lives. My focus is on AI, clean UI, and high‑quality
          engineering practices.

          I enjoy working across the stack—from designing pixel‑perfect
          interfaces to training and deploying machine learning models and
          backend systems.
